# TangleToken---Standalone-local-platform-for-testing-Tangle
TangleToken is a Tangle Implementation made on C#. TangleToken demonstrates the fundamentals of Tangle, including wallets, key pairs, asymmetric encryption, transaction mining, directed acyclic graph format and locally network nodes. This is complimented by an automatic testing platform that allows the user to generate multiple tangle nodes that automatically generate transactions.

Note: TangleToken is developed from my prior platform - TestCoin https://github.com/ElliotUoR/TestCoin---Standalone-local-platform-for-testing-Blockchain
You may notice some files and folders related to TestCoin that are leftover or unchanged from the previous platform.
